I am happy to advise you on the best painting techniques for various services. I work for both private individuals and companies in the Aalsmeer, Amstelveen, Uithoorn and surrounding area. Below, I briefly discuss my range of services. Of course, I will also advise you extensively during my visit. That way, you can be sure to make the right choice with the desired result. I work with the professional paint of the Sikkens brand.

### Interior painting

A staircase, the walls, a window section, skirting boards or a ceiling, I provide all indoor painting services. Painting the inside of your property not only offers protection, but also gives you the chance to reflect your own style. I am happy to give you advice on, for example, the use of colour in a room, light, trends and different finishes. Did you know, for instance, that certain light colours can make a room look bigger by reflecting light? 

Are you curious about my previous work indoors? Then take a look at my [portfolio](/portfolio)

### Exterior painting

You've also come to the right place for painting the outside of your premises. Facades in the Netherlands have a hard time with the ever-changing weather. This causes woodwork in particular to deteriorate quickly. Not only is this bad for your property, but it also doesn't benefit the appearance of your property. 

I always inspect for wood rot first. Painting directly over wood rot is very unwise and certainly not sustainable. After any wood rot has been repaired, the exterior painting can begin. I only work with high-quality products and techniques, which ensures long-term quality. After completion, your home is protected again against all kinds of weather conditions and you can enjoy the result every day.

### Wood rot repair

A common problem in maintaining your home is the presence of wood rot. Moisture in the wood of your doors, window frames or sill, for example, causes a stubborn fungus which can eventually lead to wood rot. The wood is darker in colour, the hardness of the wood decreases and eventually it even shows cracks. An annoying problem, but certainly not insurmountable and (if discovered in time) easy to treat.

I thoroughly remove the wood rot, impregnate the remaining wood, replenish and rework the surface. In some cases, parts of the wood will have to be replaced. I do all this with great care, because any residual mould or wood rot left behind will spread again. Of course, I finish it all in detail. This way, wood rot becomes a thing of the past.
