# About the project

Our client bought an existing house. Eline van Lenthe, my interior consultant, created an interior design. And I carried this out.

The interior advice included a mood board and suggestions for: colours, sofa arrangement, flooring, wall colour, material and furniture arrangement. A plasterer plastered the walls in the living room, hall and ceiling in the master bedroom. 

Plasterboarded the ceiling in the dormer of the master bedroom so the ceiling could be plastered smooth. Then painted the walls and wallpapered one wall.

All walls whitewashed in the hallway, stairwell, living room and 2 bedrooms. 

Also made a heating conversion, hung lamps and replaced sockets.
