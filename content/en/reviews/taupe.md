en => Monique refurbished our bedrooms and study: wallpapering, electrics, blinds, wardrobes, etc. Monique is very reliable, precise, responsible and a pleasure to work with. And also flexible.  Monique is also communicatively strong and open to improvements. She can work hard and keeps going until we were satisfied.
