I have no hesitation in recommending Monique. She gave a realistic quote (how long the work should take and cost). Her work was excellent.  She always turned up on time, she tidied the tools and hoovered the floor every day before she left.  Very professional and also friendly.  A big bonus that she speaks English and Dutch.  Monique replaced part of our ceiling that had water damage, removed wallpaper, hung new wallpaper, and painted.
