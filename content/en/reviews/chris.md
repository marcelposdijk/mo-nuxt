en => Monique painted my window frames on the inside. I like things to be perfect and normally always do these things myself, but I outsourced this anyway. And luckily I don't regret it, her work is excellent and she works neatly. When she has finished, everything is tidied up as if nothing had happened except that the window frames look tip-top again.
Monique thank you and I hope I can call on you again for the next paint job.
